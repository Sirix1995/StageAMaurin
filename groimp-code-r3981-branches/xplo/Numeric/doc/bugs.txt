Possible Bugs in Apache Commons Math
====================================


* Problem with integration when state vector has zero length:
some integrators cannot compute the error estimate needed to
perform automatic step size control
=> fixed by ???

* Problem with root finding in integrator:
t(0) = 0, x(0) = 1; dt/dt = 1, dx/dt = 0.1*x
monitor sin(t*PI), trigger println(t), maxCheckInterval=0.25,
  convergence=1e-20, maxIterations=20
integrate(20)
=> should print values of t from 0 to 20,
  but instead some values are t+stepSize, where stepSize is the
  step size of the fixed step integrator (like Euler, RK4)

* Problems with root finding in integrator:
(confirmed for DormandPrince54Integrator in ACM2.2)
when multiple events trigger at the same time and return STOP,
only one of the events is actually handled, the other are skipped
because STOP was requested
problem is in AbstractIntegrator.acceptStep, so should apply to
all integrators provided by ACM2.2
