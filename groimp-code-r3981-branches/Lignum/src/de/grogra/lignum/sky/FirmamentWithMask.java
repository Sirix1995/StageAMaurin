//At this moment the class can only work with a very specific file format which is not allowed
//to include comments.

/**
 * This class tries to model a gap in a forest. 
 * The gaps are often (?) analyzed by foresters by taking photograhs  with fish-eye lenses.
 * The size and the form of the gap is further analyzed by marking the path of the sun
 * in the photograph and the effect of the direct and diffuse radiation can be estimated (somehow).
 * The idea of this class is simply to mimic such fish-eye photograph and to model the effect
 * of the blocked incoming radiation, direct and diffuse. Thus the name FirmamentWithMask.
 * Ideally the user could define the gap (i.e., the photograph) in a file, though in a somewhat simplified manner.
 * Methods:
 * 1. readMaskFile
 *    Read the mask file and adjust radiation
 * 2. setMask
 *    This naive approach: in a file for each inclination the percentage of remaining radiation is given
 *    100% means gap, less than 100% means obstacle.
 * (original Lignum comment)
 * 
 * Translated from orignal C++ Lignum code
