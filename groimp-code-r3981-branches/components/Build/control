Description: GroIMP is a 3D-modelling platform	
 The GroIMP (Growth Grammar-related Interactive Modelling Platform) software 
 demonstrates the concept of “Relational Growth Grammars” and illustrates it 
 in its concrete implementation, namely the high-level language XL which 
 combines the rule-based programming paradigm of graph grammars and L-systems 
 with the imperative and object-oriented programming paradigm of Java.
